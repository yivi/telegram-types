# Telegram API Types

These are classes meant to cover all the possible responses on [Telegram's BOT API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

The classes have been all automatically generated from the wonderful work of @PaulSonOfLars on [telegram-bot-api-spec](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/telegram-bot-api-spec/tree/main).

The current version was generated from the API version **Bot API 7.10**, released on September 6, 2024.
